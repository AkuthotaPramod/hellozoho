Subject: Sick leave application

Dear srikanth,

With reference to the above subject, I want to bring to your kind attention that I am suffering from allergy and my doctor has suggested taking through rest for five days initially. The doctor also recommended going for MRI scan along with a week of physiotherapy sessions and other medications.

I am not aware of my future possibilities for leave as the situation is based on how much rest can I take. 

I request you to please grant me leave for five days, i.e. from (starting date) to (end-date) for the betterment and speedy recovery of my lower back. Also, let me know if any further clarifications are required for the case. I am attaching my medical certificate along with this email.

I can be communicated at (email address) and on (phone number) in the case for any queries and emergency situations. Besides, I have explained the tasks to (colleague name) to be taken care of in my absence.

Yours Sincerely,

A.pramod
